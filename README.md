Tea Leaf Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
This project aims to detect diseases in tea leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of tea leaves affected by various diseases.

Usage
To run the notebook, you'll need the following packages installed:

Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
TensorFlow
Keras

Once you have the required packages installed, you can open and run the mtealeafsample.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the CNN model and evaluate its performance.

Results
The CNN model achieved promising results in detecting tea leaf diseases, demonstrating its potential for automated disease diagnosis in agriculture. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are presented in the notebook along with visualizations of the model's performance.
